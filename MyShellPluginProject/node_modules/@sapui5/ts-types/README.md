# @sapui5/ts-types

This npm package contains the types signatures for all the SAPUI5 libraries.

These signatures can be used to:

1. Enable advanced content assist in IDEs, e.g: (VSCode / IntelliJ / Webstorm) for SAPUI5.
1. Integrate type checking for SAPUI5 applications using the TypeScript compiler.

These two capabilities are available both for SAPUI5 apps written in TypeScript **and** in JavaScript.
