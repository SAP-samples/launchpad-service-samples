# Developing a Shell Plugin for SAP Fiori Launchpad Service on SAP BTP (Multi-Cloud Environment) with SAP Business Application Studio

## Description
Developers can extend the functionality of SAP Fiori Launchpad service using shell plugins. The concept of plugins allows SAP Fiori implementers to hook into the Launchpad Shell and add new elements like menu items, custom footers, header extensions, and many more. 

This sample shows how to extend your SAP Fiori Launchpad service on SAP BTP (Multi-Cloud environment) via an HTML5 application/shell plugin managed by SAP BTP. In this example we will add a button to the SAP Fiori Launchpad header that opens a pop-up with some basic information.
